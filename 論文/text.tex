\abst{In recent years, annealing machine have been developed, and their use methods are considered in fields such as optimization problems and machine learning. In the annealing machine, it is necessary to express the problem to be dealt with in QUBO(Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) formulation and implement it as hardware. 
However, since the general method of rewriting to the QUBO format is not known yet, it needs to be derived individually. In this paper, we derive the QUBO formulation for the l1 norm (absolute value function) used in sparse estimation. As a result of experiment, it was possible to predict that one variable could be reduced from the result of numerical experiment by applying the Legendre transformation and Wolf-duality theorem to l1norm. By reviewing the formulation we were actually able to reduce one variable. In addition, as a result of conducting numerical experiments using the derived l1norm, it was confirmed that a sparse solution could be obtained.}

\section{Introduction}
In recent yeaars, sepecial machines for annealing have benn developed such as D-Wave, digital annealer and CMOS annealing machine, and methods for use in various fields are being considered. The annealing machine acceptes Ising model parameters as input, but there are many functions thathave been represented yet because systematic derivation of the Ising model has been shown.
In the previous researches, the robust q-loss function is derived in the QUBO form using the Legendre transform, and its performance is evaluated using the classification problem as an example. Also, in the recently published papaer on the derivation of the ReLU function in the QUBO form, the derivation has made using the Wofle-duality theorem, so that the Legendre transformation alone is insufficient.
On the other hand, sparse estimation is used in the fields of image processing and machine learning, and it is an important research in reducing the number of data, selecting related data from high-dimensional and complex data and making it simple.
The purpose of this research is to derive an l1-norm, which is a regularization term of Lasso used in sparse estimation, in the QUBO form using the derivation method in [ReLUの論文番号].Furthemore, we evaluate whether the derived result is correct using simulated anneaing, and compare the results of Lasso(coordinate descent) and Lasso(simulated anneailng) to evaluate the performance. In the results, we verify that the estimate converges to zero.
